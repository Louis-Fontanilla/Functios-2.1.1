# Development of Functios, a Mobile Application on the Uses of Functional Groups
Functios is aimed to be a supplementary learning material for organic chemistry students, specifically on the topic of functional groups. Functios contains 14 functional groups, with three real-world uses or occurrences for each. There are also nomenclature examples with explanations to help students master naming organic compounds.

## Authors

This app was developed by Louis Fontanilla, Kyla Kiunisala, and Miah Sales from Philippine Science High School Main Campus with the assistance and guidance of their Research Adviser, Mr. Roy Canseco. 

## Installation/ setup

Follow this GDrive link and download the .apk file to your Android device.

When opening the app for the first time, a tutorial of the app will appear, showing the different features of the app and how to use them. Click the left and right buttons at the bottom to move between tutorial images.

The home screen shows the directory of the 14 functional groups included in the app. Clicking on one functional group will lead to its corresponding Use page, which shows the functional groups real-life uses and occurrences, along with nomenclature examples. A search bar is also present at the top of the home screen. The user can bookmark a Use by clicking the corresponding icon. The bookmarks page contains all current bookmarks of the user.

Each functional group’s Use page contains its Overview, Uses, and Nomenclature. There are three uses per functional group and two examples on nomenclature with sufficient explanation.

The hamburger menu (icon: ≡) at the upper right of each page leads to the navigation page.The navigation page contains buttons for the home page, bookmark page, tutorial walkthrough, about page, and sources.
